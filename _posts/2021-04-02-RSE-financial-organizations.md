This blog post is intended to talk about how different RSE associations
financially function (purely volunteer; income from membership, events,
sponsors, etc.; costs for events, staff, other). While it is now being
posted as a blog, it's really a snapshot in time, as we expect the
RSE associations to change their financial models over time. This post
may be useful to the existing organizations that want to consider
changes, and to new organization that need to make financial decisions.

* be-RSE: The Belgian Research Software Association is not a formal organisation yet, 
nor is it financially independant.
All efforts is driven by volunteers of various organisations. At the moment, two organisations, 
VIB and KU Leuven are driving the activities.

* de-RSE: membership fees (~60 €/y): not that much, plan to support
local groups and national conference

* Nordic-RSE: not financial as yet but funded by a “Nordic project”.
No membership fees yet.

* NL-RSE: not a formal organization in any way. Membership is only to
the mailing list. NL-RSE is backed by the Netherlands eScience Center
which has promised a community manager to actually organize events on
behalf of NL-RSE. The Netherlands eScience Center has also paid for the
venue costs at the NL-RSE conference in 2019. We had several companies
approach us for sponsoring the 2019 conference, but since we are not a
formal organization with a bank account we couldn’t accept any sponsoring
at the time.

* RSE-AUNZ: not financial as yet. All effort is volunteer. We are
interested in finding out about paths that get us to a place where we can
begin financing our own website, media, events, etc.

* Society of RSE: Registered with the UK Charity Commission as a
Charitable Incorporated Organisation with Charity Number
[1182455](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/charity-details/5125299).
As such, it has a bank account and annual reports finances to the government
and to its membership (e.g. [in 2020](https://bit.ly/socrse-accounts-2020)).
 
* US-RSE: not currently a formal organization in any way. Membership is
only via our mailing list. As of early April 2021, we are in the process
of setting up a financial account for the organization via
[Open Collective Foundation](https://opencollective.com/foundation).
