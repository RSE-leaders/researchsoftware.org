A blog post from the [*2nd International RSE Leaders Workshop 2020*](https://researchsoftware.org/2020-workshop.html).


### The Challenge: New Roles in Old Institutions

Research Software Engineers (RSEs) are popping up everywhere across the
research landscape. They may manage research data, administer
High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters, or develop scientific
software, to name a few of their activities. RSEs have the background
and skills to deal with the unique challenges that arise from the
technical side of science. As demand for their services booms, a single
RSE may quickly find themself managing a whole RSE group. However, their
roles are rather novel, so it can be difficult to structure such a group
or find a place in relatively rigid academic structures. How should a
fledgling group leader organize their group? What are the pitfalls of
different structures/models?

### Our Approach: Learn What Works (And What Doesn't)

A lot can be learned from existing groups and what has led them to adopt
a particular group structure. We plan to examine how existing groups
work, collate existing information, and offer a kind of 'recipe book'
for founding new ones. However, it is clear that this is not a
"one-size-fits all" problem, and that groups differ along a number of
crucial dimensions. At the 2nd International RSE Leaders Workshop, held
remotely on September 2020, we developed the following strategy:

-   Identify existing knowledge, and knowledge gaps about RSE groups
-   Define the dimensions along which groups differ to provide guidance
    on the organisation of new groups
-   Develop a method to address knowledge gaps by surveying existing RSE
    groups
-   Organise the compiled information into a "recipe book" with guidance
    for existing and newly created RSE groups

### How RSE Groups Work
There is a wide variety of team structures and processes within
        RSE groups, which of course depend on the group's size, amongst
        other things. For example, teams can be structured based on
        projects, based on cross-role teams (e.g., scrum teams), or
        based on skills (e.g., web interfaces, HPC).

How specific projects are assigned to teams often follows this
        structure and what's possible is often constrained by the
        details of how funding and collaboration works within each
        organisation. Similarly, the more institutional support/core
        funding a group has, the easier it is for a group to operate as
        a unified team assigning members to projects and activities
        flexibly according to skills and experience. This in turn makes
        it easier to have technical specialisms, agile team approaches
        or multiple levels of seniority than if the group has to be more
        rigid about which people are hired to work on which grants, for
        instance. Another aspect of this mapping is the use of agile
        principles, which can be very appealing to RSE groups, but hard
        to apply in practice in many cases, as many specific
        methodologies developed within commercial teams (such as scrum)
        don\'t fit a typical RSE group context for various reasons. For
        example, it\'s rare to have multiple developers able to focus
        100% on one project, and in fact, some groups don\'t allow
        developers to do this to avoid potential \"project capture\" and
        single points-of-failure.

In addition, an overall RSE group includes people with different
        roles (e.g. team line managers, technical project managers, lead
        developers, architects, programmers, scrum masters, QA testers)
        and these roles need to be considered in both developing a group
        structure and making effective assignments of projects to
        groups. Another aspect is how these roles fit into the
        organisation\'s formal titles and human resources structure, and
        specifically, for each of those more formal roles, what are the
        titles, salaries, requirements, etc. One of a group's activities
        should be to mentor the staff to advance in these roles, and to
        get the training, education, and on-the-job experience needed
        for them to do so.

A group also needs to attract (or choose) projects to work on,
        hopefully based on some strategy and not just doing whatever
        work is available to keep the group members employed. This is
        tied to the financial model of the group, which could include
        full or partial institution (core) support for some or all of
        the team members, support based on the group or its members
        writing proposals to a funding body, either for group-developed
        projects or those done jointly with users, and support based on
        "customers" approaching the group with work to be done.

A last aspect to groups is where they fit into their
        organizational structure, such as reporting to the research part
        of the organization and being responsible for all disciplines,
        reporting to the IT part of the organization and being
        responsible for all disciplines, or reporting to a smaller unit
        (a department, a school, a faculty) and being focused on work
        within that unit's discipline.

One example is the Netherlands eScience Center, which currently
        uses a mixed model where some RSEs are working as part of a team
        while others are working in one or several more loosely formed
        project-related teams. The formal teams follow the agile
        methodology of their choice, whether it's Scrum or Kanban. The
        teams work on a set of related projects, either from the same
        domain or using similar technology. The teams often focus on a
        specific project in each sprint or iteration, while the other
        projects are on hold. Within teams, each project that is worked
        on by the team has a product/project owner, who directly
        communicates with the stakeholders of the project and defines
        the stories/issues for the team to work on. The RSEs who are not
        in a formal team work on a more individual basis usually on
        multiple projects simultaneously, having more control themselves
        on how they divide their time over projects and other
        activities. Projects typically span multiple years, so the
        engineer-project assignments do not change that often.

### Dimensions of RSE Groups

The description above illustrates that there are many different
operational models for RSE groups and that groups differ across a number
of dimensions. If we are to better inform new groups, a system of
categorisation would help organise the content of our recipe book so
that it is relevant. The categories could provide a way to arrange
information that new groups could easily find documents that relate to
their situation, or to find other groups in a similar environment to
compare their solutions for common problems. For example, information
about possible management approaches may depend on the size of the
group: management approaches for a group of 50 RSEs may not be
appropriate for a new group of 5 RSEs. As a first proposal, we list some
key categories of RSE groups:

-   Business/financial model - Through full or partial core
    institutional funding? A "customer" approach? Active participation
    in grant proposals?
-   Management structure - What roles do the RSEs take on within the
    group? How is the group organized on a day-to-day basis? How do
    members\' careers progress? Who has leadership and makes the
    strategy?
-   Demographics of the individual RSEs - What is their professional
    background? Do they come from academia? Do they have a PhD?
-   Working culture - Do they promote open-source? Do they seek to
    exploit commercial opportunities? How flexible are the working hours
    and work environment?
-   Institutional context - How does the group fit within its housing
    institution? What is their origin/history? Who are they accountable
    to? How large are they?
-   Technical focus - What kind of services do they provide? (HPC,
    Web-Platforms, Databases, etc.)
-   Subject focus - What fields of science are they active in? How
    specialized are they?

### Knowledge Base

We already have a reasonable amount of knowledge about the
        methods and dimensions of existing groups from previous
        activities, including surveys, publications, and materials
        banks.

The surveys include:

-   [*Ongoing "International RSE Group Organisation Survey" run by Ian Cosden and Catherine Jones*](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VYTfl0go62_PEo7aVxQXnKFD0e2PqWw6NCDGeUy_mzY/viewform)
-   A 2018 [*survey of UK RSE group
    leaders*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tw5HwT4-iOXHYFHx-2AkaSwcZTSiDwEQMknH1LZtdFE/edit?usp=sharing)
    by Hettrick examined the current and projected size of UK RSE
    groups, as well as the demand for their services and for the
    conversion rate of leads into group projects.
-   The [*annual survey of Research Software Engineers*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1194668)- indirectly through
    questions relating to employment

In addition, we know of two relevant papers and one dataset.
            \"[*Research Software Development & Management in
            Universities: Case Studies from Manchester\'s RSDS Group,
            Illinois\' NCSA, and Notre Dame\'s
            CRC*](https://doi.org/10.1109/SE4Science.2019.00009)\"
            ([*preprint*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00732)) by Katz et
            al. reviews three exemplar RSE groups (two in the US and one
            in the UK.) It covers group/governance structure, financing,
            career path within groups, as well as advantages of having
            RSE groups. \"[*The Industrial Ecology Digital
            Lab*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.997903)\" by Stadler et
            al. describes the setup of the Industrial Ecology Digital
            Laboratory, focusing on the tasks and infrastructure.

Finally, there are several resources containing information
            on how different RSE groups work. The material banks below
            are a good starting point for finding further information:

-   The [*RSE society resources database*](https://society-rse.org/resources-database/)contains links and
    information on RSE groups
-   The [*RSE leaders evidence bank*](https://github.com/RSE-leaders/evidence-bank/)contains documents
    arranged by institution and partially tagged by goal, type and
    audience.
-   The [*Research Software Alliance library of publications on the importance of research software*](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2400609/resa/library) contains a
    crowd-sourced literature search on the role research software
    engineers and groups have played in academic research.

### Repositories of RSE Groups

There are a set of existing lists that include groups identifying
themselves as RSE groups, Existing groups can add themselves to the
appropriate list.

-   [*DE RSE map*](https://de-rse.org/en/map.html)
-   [*UK RSE groups*](https://society-rse.org/community/rse-groups/)
-   [*US RSE groups*](https://us-rse.org/rse-groups/)
-   [*NL RSE groups*](https://nl-rse.org/pages/community.html)
-   [*Nordic RSE Map*](https://nordic-rse.org/map/)

However, large parts of the academic infrastructure is managed by
organizational structures which are basically RSE groups but currently
do not self identify as such (HPC groups, IT support groups, and so on).
If you do establish an RSE group, please make sure to be added to one of
these repositories.

### Surveying Existing RSE Groups

While RSEs are a relatively new concept, there is already a considerable
knowledge base available. To gather more data, we could collect
unstructured data through interviews, with topics based on the existing
knowledge base. To collect structured data, we could create a short
on-line survey. In either case, to begin this work, we would need to:

-   Formulate questions for leaders of existing groups
-   Decide whether to use interviews or a survey, and if there we will
    use a survey, will it be new or included in an existing survey
-   Obtain human subjects (IRB, ethics) permission for our study

We could also aim at collaboratively writing a report or paper with
multiple RSE group leaders, either after a survey/interviews or
independently.

### Next Steps

A lot can be learned from existing RSE groups. However, this knowledge
is dispersed across groups, diverse and context specific and often not
well documented. Sharing and collecting this knowledge will require a
large community effort. Members of existing groups will need to share
their knowledge by contributing to surveys. And volunteers in the
community, such as the authors of this blog post, will need to work
together to collate and synthesise this information. The proposed
'recipe book' will help collect and organise this knowledge to assist in
the foundation of new RSE groups.
