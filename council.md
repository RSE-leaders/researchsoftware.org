The different existing [national and multinational associations](./assoc.md) have always informally talked and collaborated by a variety of means.

The **International Council of RSE Associations** (*the Council*) provides a formal open forum for established national and multinational RSE associations to talk and coordinate regularly, and thus sustain international collaboration.

The Council consists of delegates from the established RSE associations, who meet regularly to coordinate, discuss and collaborate. It is governed by a charter (currently being drafted). Further national or multinational RSE associations can join the Council once they pass a threshold for establishment that is defined in the charter.

To maintain openness towards the community and facilitate further knowledge exchange and support, representatives of nascent communities can join Council meetings as observing participants, ask questions and discuss issues at the end of meetings.
