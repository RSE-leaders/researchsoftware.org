# International Research Software Engineers website

This is the website of the international research software engineering community.  

Research Software Engineers are people who combine professional software expertise with an understanding of research. They work in many contexts and may have various job titles but the term Research Software Engineer (RSE) is fast gaining international recognition.

In January, leaders of national RSE associations, local RSE groups and related initiatives from around the world came together in London for the first International RSE Leaders Workshop, organised by the UK RSE Association. This website and some initial blog posts and resources sprang from the breakout groups.
