---


## The short version

If you have a question about the code of conduct or wish to report
misconduct, please email the International Council of RSE Associations
(the Council) at
[*intl-rse-council@listserv.dfn.de*](mailto:intl-rse-council@listserv.dfn.de),
the rotating chair of the next Council meeting, or [*any member of the
Council*](https://researchsoftware.org/council.html).

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave
professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or
exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for the International Council of
RSE Associations.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
imagery are not appropriate.

The International Council of RSE Associations is dedicated to providing
a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of age, disability,
gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and
parenthood, race, religion or belief (or lack thereof), gender identity
and expression, sex, sexual orientation, technical choices, experience
level or any other dimension of diversity. We do not tolerate harassment
of community members in any form.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

## About the Code of Conduct

The International Council of RSE Associations (the Council) provides a
formal open forum for established national and multinational RSE
associations to talk and coordinate regularly, and thus sustain
international collaboration. We are committed to creating a welcoming
and supportive environment for all of our members. All participants in
our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy
to others.

This Code of Conduct should be honoured by everyone who participates in
the International Council of RSE Associations, as member, guest, or in
another role. It should be honoured in all Council activities, by anyone
claiming affiliation with the Council, and especially when someone is
representing the Council in any role (including as an event volunteer,
organiser or speaker).

This Code of Conduct outlines our behaviour expectations as members of
the Council in all Council activities, both offline and online.
Everyone's participation is contingent upon following these guidelines
in all activities associated with the Council including but not limited
to:

-   Council meetings
-   Email lists and online forums like Slack, Twitter, GitHub, and
    LinkedIn
-   Representing the Council at public events

As a relatively small organization, the Council itself is responsible
for enforcing the Code of Conduct and all reports about misconduct will
be dealt with promptly and in accordance with the Enforcement* *Manual
(see below).

Behaviours that are disrespectful to our members or events' attendees
and sponsors, or intimidate, exclude or cause discomfort to others will
not be tolerated. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based
on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, age,
disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership,
pregnancy and parenthood, race, religion or belief (or lack thereof),
gender identity and expression, sex, sexual orientation, technical
choices, experience level or any other dimension of diversity.

The Council is responsible for the enforcement of this Code of Conduct
and for dealing with misconduct or violations to this policy. Council
members are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of
Conduct in their respective capacities. By participating, individuals
indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which the Council
resolves any Code of Conduct incidents, which might include storage and
processing of their personal information.

## Expected behaviour

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show
respect and courtesy to others and all interactions should be
professional, both online and in-person.

The following kinds of behaviours in all Council events and platforms
are encouraged:

-   Focusing on what is best for the community
-   Showing courtesy and respect towards every member of the community
-   Being respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
-   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
-   Using welcoming and inclusive language
-   Adhering to the Code of Conduct
-   Being direct, but professional
-   Asking for consent and respecting people's boundaries
-   Being aware of the dynamics of power and privilege (be mindful of
    how much time and space you are taking up)

## Unacceptable behaviour

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

-   Publication of private communication without consent
-   Excessive swearing
-   Improper gestures
-   Use of stereotypes
-   Incitement to violence, suicide or self-harm
-   Sustained disruptions of talks, workshops events or communications
-   The display of violent images
-   Causing someone to fear for their safety through stalking,
    following, intimidation, or threatening
-   Unwelcome and repeated flirtations, propositions, advances, or other
    sexual attention -- including gratuitous or off-topic sexual images
    or behaviour
-   Non-consensual or unwelcome physical contact
-   Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary
    jokes
-   Continuing to initiate interaction with someone after being
    explicitly asked to stop
-   Offensive, insulting, derogatory, or degrading remarks
-   Demands for sexual favours in exchange for favourable or
    preferential treatment
-   Advocating for, or encouraging any of the above behaviours

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are
expected to comply immediately. This applies to any event or platform,
either online or in-person. If an event participant engages in behaviour
that violates this code of conduct, the organizers may warn the
offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund), or
engage the Council to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and
impose appropriate sanctions.

## Incident reporting guidelines

If you believe that someone is violating the Code of Conduct, please
report this in a timely manner. Code of Conduct violations reduce the
value of the community for everyone. The Council takes reports of
misconduct very seriously and is committed to preserving and maintaining
the welcoming nature of our community.

**All reports will be kept confidential.**

Any violations to the Code of Conduct during Council events should be
immediately reported to the event host, organiser or the designated
incident person/people. The people handling the incident report should
also make a direct report to the Council by emailing the rotating chair
of the next Council meeting. If you are uncomfortable emailing this
rotating chair, incidents can also be reported directly to any Council
member.

If the violation occurs in an online space, reports should be emailed
directly to the rotating chair of the next meeting or any other Council
[*member*](https://researchsoftware.org/council.html).

The person to whom a report is made is hereafter referred to as \"the
Contact\".

All reports will be reviewed by the Council and will be kept
confidential to the extent possible in a small group.

In your report, please do your best to include:

-   Your contact information
-   Identifying information of the reported person
-   The behaviour associated with the Code of Conduct violation
-   If possible, where the Code of Conduct violation happened
-   The approximate time of the behaviour (if different than the time
    the report was made)
-   The circumstances surrounding the incident
-   Other people involved or that witnessed the incident
-   If there is a publicly available record (i.e. email thread, Slack
    messages, Twitter threads)
-   If you believe this is an ongoing situation, please let us know
-   Any additional helpful information

## What to do if someone is in immediate danger?

If you believe someone is in immediate danger, please ask a Council
member to contact appropriate emergency responders. All event organizers
should, before the event, determine who would be appropriate to contact
in case of an incident and make sure this information is available at
all times over the duration of the event in question.

Once the incident has been resolved, we ask that it be reported to the
Council in the same way as all other incidents.

## Enforcement manual

The following section details the enforcement manual followed by the
Council. It is used when we respond to an issue to make sure we are
consistent and fair on every instance. Enforcement of the Code of
Conduct should be respectful and not include any harassing behaviours.

All responses to reports of conduct violations will be managed by the
Council itself.. To write to the Council and for the current membership,
see
[*https://researchsoftware.org/council.html*](https://researchsoftware.org/council.html).

### How will the Council respond to reports?

When a report is sent to the Council, a member will reply to the report
to confirm receipt within 24 hours. If a report does not contain enough
information, the Council will attempt to obtain all relevant data before
acting, including contacting any individuals involved to get a
comprehensive account of events. Once a report has been filed, one of
the Council members will be assigned as the main acting member
responsible for any communications with the involved individual(s).

The Council is also empowered to act if any of its members becomes aware
of ongoing behaviour that, taken as a whole over a long time period, is
disrupting or harassing. Such behaviour might not be "over the line" in
any single incident, and thus may not generate a report.

### Immediate response

The initial response to an incident is very important. Depending on the
severity and details of the incident, an immediate response may be
required.

In situations involving immediate danger or involving a threat to
anyone's safety, any member of the Council may -- and should -- act
immediately to protect the safety of the individual(s) in such a
situation. This can include contacting law enforcement or crisis
resources.

If a Council member acts before reviewing the situation within the
Council, , they must inform the other Council members as soon as
possible, and report their actions to the Council for review within 24
hours.

### Ongoing incidents

If the action is ongoing, whether in person or online, any Council
member may act immediately and employ any available means to diffuse the
situation including bans and blocks. In situations where an individual
Council member acts immediately, they must inform the other Council
members as soon as possible, and report their actions to the Council for
review within 24 hours.

### Less-urgent situations

Once a report is filed, the Council will review the incident and
determine, to the best of their ability:

-   Whether this is an ongoing situation
-   Whether there is a threat to anyone's safety
-   What happened
-   Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation
-   Who, if anyone, was the bad actor
-   Whether any communications should be made to the wider community

This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the
Council's deliberations will be recorded and retained (e.g., email
discussions, recorded voice conversations, etc).

The Council should aim to have a resolution agreed upon within one week.
In the event that a resolution can't be determined in that time, the
Council will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and the projected
timeline for resolution.

### Resolutions

The Council must agree on a resolution by consensus of all members
investigating the report in question.

Possible outcomes may include:

-   Taking no further action (if it is determined that there was no
    violation).
-   A private reprimand from the Council to the individual(s) involved.
    In this case, the Contact will deliver that reprimand to the
    individual(s) over email, cc'ing the Council.
-   Ending a talk that violates the Code of Conduct early
-   A public announcement of an incident, ideally in the same venue that
    the violation occurred.
-   Immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and
    privileges the individual(s) hold(s).
-   An imposed suspension from the Council platforms. The Contact will
    communicate this suspension to the individual(s). They'll be asked
    to take this suspension voluntarily, but if they don't agree then a
    temporary ban may be imposed to enforce this suspension.
-   A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Council spaces.
-   Assistance to the complainant with a report to other bodies, for
    example, institutional offices or appropriate law enforcement
    agencies.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the Council
will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and
explain the proposed resolution. The Council will ask if this resolution
is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record. However, the
Council is not required to act on this feedback.

### Conflicts of interest

In the event of any conflict of interest (a Council member, their family
member, or someone with whom the Council member has a close academic,
employment, or personal relationship is involved in a complaint), the
Council member must immediately notify the other members, and recuse
themselves if necessary.
